### Q: What convinced you to apply to Y Combinator? Did someone encourage you to apply? Have you been to any YC events?

When I applied to YC in 2017 with a different startup, I got advice from a Product Manager working in the Bay Area that if I was going to apply to accelerators, YC would be the only one worth applying to. 

In the last 10 years, I've observed that to be true. Every interaction I've had with YC founders and their people at YC companies has been exceptionally positive and memorable. And the content that YC has posted on YouTube has served as my compass and source of truth for startup wisdom.
