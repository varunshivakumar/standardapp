# Standard App - Idea

## Why

*Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?*

I’m building a product that I can pass onto my future children, my family and my peers so that we can all live our best lives. As an Eagle Scout, I learned first hand how fulfilling and enriching it is to try to live a life where you aim not just for academic/professional success (like my Indian parents preached) but also for physical health, emotional health and spiritual enlightenment. There is a lack of holistic programs, communities and resources for men post-college and I’ve experienced anxiety, isolation, and depression first-hand. I’ve seen my younger brother and cousins suffer and as the eldest child on both sides of my extended family, I’ve had to experience the pain (financially, physically, emotionally) of breaking glass ceilings for them and for other friends/peers. I know that people need this because I’m surrounded by people that are desperate to find answers but lost in how they can get guidance and direction. 

I’ve partnered with the founders of another organization- Hafeez Baoku and Joseph Hines who have built a 300+ person community of like-minded men that are all committed to holistic excellence. Hafeez Baoku is a prominent podcast host, content creator, and speaker, best known as the cofounder and face of The Roommates Podcast. At its peak, The Roommatest Podcast was one of the most popular in the men's self-improvement space. His work centers on helping men grow in all areas—spiritual, emotional, physical, and financial—through honest conversations, mentorship, and personal storytelling.

## Competitors

*Who are your competitors? What do you understand about your business that they don't?*

There are no *direct* competitors. But there are innumerable indirect competitors for specific areas of life. For example:  
Financially- networking events, certifications, education  
Socially- meetups, hobbies, dating apps  
Emotionally- therapy, support groups  
Physically- personal trainer, nutritionist  
Spiritually- bible study, self-reflection of identity and purpose

The competitive advantage that I have is that the solution to the problem I’m solving actually has 3 components to it.

1. Stimulus- there needs to be some reminder, some triggering event (either internally or externally) that motivates an individual to improve themselves holistically  
2. Knowledge- collecting the information necessary to plan and execute improvements  
3. Accountability- sharing experiences with others and receiving feedback to iterate on self-development

The Standard App provides \#1  
Anyone can do a google or ChatGPT to get knowledge for \#2 so it’s inherently not difficult  
The Affluent Standard provides \#3

The Standard App and The Affluent Standard have a symbiotic partnership that allows both companies to focus on a specific part of the problem while a competitor would have to do both simultaneously.
