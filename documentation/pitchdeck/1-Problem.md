# Standard App - Problem Statement

## Problem

An increasing number of 20-something men in the current generation are less fulfilled, less coupled and more purposeless than ever before. 

## Evidence

* Evidence and statistics of young men suffering

People in the modern age feel purposeless, isolated and hopeless.

After graduating from academia, there’s no structured path for 20 and 30 somethings that pushes them to broaden their horizons in different aspects of their lives. Over time people lose friends instead of gaining them. Their career growth stagnates after the first few promotions. Time gets wasted in relationships that never started with intention. Staying physically fit as expectations and responsibilities increase. Emotional baggage compounds with more negative experiences and results in jaded perspectives. And the stories that we tell ourselves about who we are and what we want tend to become more and more deluded by the inherent negativity and toxicity in our social culture (doomsday)

The challenge for most men that want to be well-rounded is that even if you progress in one area of life, usually another area stagnates or atrophies. People end up in self-limiting stereotypical extremes. I.e., the software engineer that can’t work with others, the gym rat who feels purposeless, the teacher that lives paycheck to paycheck, or the parent that’s so overwhelmed that they have no energy to workout. And once they get stuck, they don’t have the stimulus, knowledge or community to help them move past their plateaus.

## Root Cause

The reason for this is

* Lack of role models  
* Lack of third spaces  
* Gender bias
